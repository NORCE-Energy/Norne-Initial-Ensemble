# Norne-Initial-Ensemble
This repository contains Matlab code and description for generating an initial ensemble for the Norne model. It is also possible to download a pre-computed ensemble with size 100. 

File description:

- NorneInitialEnsemble.m: 

The main function for generating the ensemble. The input to the function are ensemble size and a number     used to initialize the random generator. For more information we refer to the paper: 

Lorentzen, R., Luo, X., Bhakta, T., Valestrand, R.: "History matching
Norne reservoir and petroelastic models using seismic impedance with
correlated noise" Submitted to SPE Journal.
 
We also ask that the above paper is cited in publications aided by this code.
